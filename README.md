```bash
g++ -std=c++17 Account.cpp main.cpp -o AccountProgram

```
## Running the Project

After building, you can run the project by executing the following in your terminal:

```bash
./AccountProgram

```
Running Tests

To compile and run the tests, ensure you have Google Test installed and use the following command:

g++ -std=c++17 Account.cpp AccountTest.cpp -o AccountTest -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread

```
Then, to run the tests, execute:


```bash

./AccountTest

```
